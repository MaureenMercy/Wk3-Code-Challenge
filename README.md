index.html 
This HTML structure provides:

A header with the app's title.
A main section divided into two parts:

A movie-details section to display the current movie's information.
A movies-menu section with a films unordered list to show all available movies.


A footer with a copyright notice.
A link to an external CSS file (styles.css) for styling.
A script tag linking to your JavaScript file (script.js).

The movie-details section includes placeholders for all the required information: title, poster, runtime, showtime, available tickets, and a "Buy Ticket" button. These elements have IDs that match the ones used in the JavaScript code I provided earlier.
